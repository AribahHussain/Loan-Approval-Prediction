A loan approval prediction model was developed using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. Missing values were handled, categorical data encoded, and SMOTE used for class imbalance. Both models were evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. Logistic Regression showed balanced performance, while Decision Tree had higher recall. Visual comparisons using bar and dotted line graphs highlighted the trade-offs. This project helps automate and improve decision-making in loan approvals.
